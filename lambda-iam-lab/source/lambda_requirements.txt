# Lambda Function Requirements
# Use this for packaging Lambda deployment packages

# AWS SDK (included in Lambda runtime, but specify version for local testing)
boto3>=1.34.0

# Data processing
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Note: Keep Lambda packages minimal to reduce cold start time
# Heavy processing (GPU work) should be done in AWS Batch, not Lambda
